# ma4n1_perfect_graphs

Things we already have :
- fromRel : induce a simple graph from a relation. It symmetrizes the relation and makes it irreflexive.
- complete graph, empty graph
- complete bipartite
- IsSubgraph and IsSubraph_eq_le - input two graphs returns a bool if one is a subgraph of the other
- Sup : union of two graphs



Things we need to do:
- define perfect graphs
- define cycles
- define Complement (Complements already defined Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.hasCompl
- define induced subgraphs? 
- state strong perfect graph theorem
- state weak perfect graph theorem
- define bipartite graphs
- define heriditary graphs
- define clique number
  

Examples: 
- edgeless
- complete
- bipartite
- complement of bipartite
